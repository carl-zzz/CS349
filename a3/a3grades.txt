## REQUIREMENTS

1. [/2] In EditView, there’s an red 40 by 10 “landing pad” with it’s upper-left corner initially at (330, 100) inside a light grey “world” that is 700 by 200. The landing pad can be repositioned with a double-click: the centre of the landing pad jumps to the double-click location.

-1 landing pad cannot be repositioned  by double clicking
-1 landing pad does not begin in the center
-1 EditView varies in height upon resizing
-1 landing pad repositions to the top left corner instead of the centre after a double-click
-1 Landing pad repositions to a location other than the double-click location
-1 incorrect background color
-1 world size is incorrect.

2. [/2] The landing pad can also be dragged to a new location using the mouse. The mouse button must be pressed while the cursor is inside the landing pad to start a drag. Make sure the landing pad doesn’t “jump” when the drag action starts or ends.

-1 landing pad jumps
-1 landing pad doesn’t move until finished dragging.

3. [/2] The “terrain” is a dark grey polygon the width of worldBounds that with 20 peaks (or valleys) evenly placed horizontally across the width. Initially the height of peak is randomized to be roughly in the lower half of the game world. Each peak has a light grey circle around it (radius 15 pixels).

-1 peaks aren’t placed evenly. 
-1 peaks aren’t in lower half.
-1 peaks don’t have circles around them

4. [/2] Each peak can be dragged up and down with the mouse (only the y-coordinate changes). The mouse button must be pressed while the cursor is inside the circle to start a drag. Make sure the circle doesn’t “jump” when the drag action starts or ends.

-1 x coordinate changes too.
-1 peak jumps when dragging.
-1 peak doesn’t move until finished dragging.

5. [/2] The landing pad can never be dragged or repositioned outside of the game world. It can be dragged over top of the terrain, or through the terrain. The centre of a circle (i.e. the peak) cannot be dragged outside the game world. It can be dragged behind the landing pad.

-1 landing pad not constrained to edit view.
-1 peaks not constrained to edit view.
-1 landing pad appears behind terrain
-1 MVC: coordinates constrained in the view not model.

6. [/2] If the landing pad is on top of a circle, then pressing the mouse button on the landing pad should only drag the landing pad.

7. [/2] Pressing the Undo (or Redo) buttons in ToolbarView will undo (or redo) multiple changes to the landing pad’s position. This is regardless of whether the change was done with a double-click or a drag. The button states should be disabled if undo (or redo) is not possible.

-1 only undos one landing pad movement
-1 landing pad undo works but redo does not
-1 button states not disabled when undo/redo not possible.
-1 landing pad drag undoes but not double click
-1 landing pad double click undoes but not drag
-1 must press undo twice to undo action

8. [/2] Pressing the Undo (or Redo) button will undo (or redo) multiple changes to terrain circles. The button states should be disabled if undo (or redo) is not possible.

-1 only undos one terrain movement
-1 terrain undo works but redo does not
-1 button states not disabled when undo not possible.
-1 must press undo twice

9. [/2] The undo and redo actions should work for a sequence of adjustments to different circles and for adjustment to the landing pad in between adjustments to circles.

-1 Only undos changes to one terrain peak and one landing pad change.

10. [/2] The granularity of undo and redo actions should be properly “chunked”.

-1 chunking works properly for undo but not redo
-1 chunking is not done properly for adjustment to the landing pad 

11. [/2] A ship, rendered as a 10x10 blue square in the game world, is displayed at an initial position of 350,50 in the game world. In the PlayView panel, the game world is scaled by 3 and the ship is always centred (only the game world should move around it). The ship is only visible in PlayView.

-1 initial position is wrong
-1 ship is not always centered
-1 scale is off
-1 ship is visible in the EditView

12. [/2] The ship is controlled using the keyboard. W,A,S,D keys add thrust to the ship up, left, down, or right. Pressing SPACE should pause or unpause the ship movement . When paused, the thrust keys should have no effect.

-1 movement is choppy
-1 game does not pause
-1 ship does not move

13. [/2] The MessageView should display the current fuel and speed of the ship (there are methods in Ship that return exactly these amounts). If the fuel goes below 10, the fuel text should turn RED. If the ship is paused, then “(Paused)” should appear.

-1 fuel text doesn't turn red
-1 paused does not appear
-1 some values do not update

14. [/2] The ship should crash if it touches any part of the terrain or it goes beyond the world bounds. When it crashes, the message “CRASH” is shown. Pressing SPACE after a crash restarts the game.

-1 ship does not crash at world bounds
-1 pressing space does not restart the game

15. [/2] The ship should land if it touches the landing pad with a speed less than the amount returned bymodel.ship.getSafeLandingSpeed(). The speed label is green when the ship speed is “safe”. When it lands, the message “LANDED!” is shown. If the ship touches the landing pad at a speed equal or greater to getSafeLandingSpeed(), then it crashes and the word “CRASH” is shown in message. Pressing SPACE after a landing or a crash restarts the game.

-1 speed label color doesn't update
-1 pressing space does not restart the game
-1 ship doesn’t crash regardless of the speed at which it hits the landing pad
-1 no message is shown

## ENHANCEMENT [/2]

-1  enhanced version not described in a comment at the top of A3Enhanced code
-1 enhancement is too simple, near-trivial for full marks

## GENERAL [/5] (can be negative)

-3 very slow, obviously doing something inefficient. 
-1 unnecessary system or build files submitted
-3 very few or no comments at all beyond those copied from demo code
-1 some comments, but poor or token ones

-1 Model has methods specific to controller events (like mouse actions)
-1 model is coupled to specific view types (not using View interface or Java Observer)
-2 no MVC design at all (this will be in addition to marks deducted above)

-3 make run does not properly run the code
-1 makefile usage unclear and/or undocumented, details: <explain what happens when you make and/or run>

-5 won’t compile in Virtual Machine, had to be debugged and fixed by marker. Details:
-5 crashes in Virtual Machine, had to be debugged and fixed by marker, (please submit a remark request if there is an easy fix we couldn’t find) details:
-1 crashes once, but hard to reproduce or very infrequent 
-3 runs enough to mark functionality, but crashes sometimes, details:
