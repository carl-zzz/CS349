## REQUIREMENTS

1. [0/2] Your app should have a welcome screen with game name, very brief game instructions, and some interface methods to start a game or change game settings.

-1 No name
-1 No instructions
-1 No settings button

2. [1/2] Starting the game means the game interface is displayed, changing game settings means a settings interface is displayed.

-1 no settings interface is displayed

3. [0/2] The settings interface has a method to set the number of Simon buttons in the game (between 1 and 6) and a method to select among three levels of difficulty (“Easy”, “Normal”, and “Hard”: requirement 9 covers how difficulty level works).

-1 cannot adjust difficulty
-1 cannot adjust number of buttons

4. [2/2] The game interface has at least a score, a place for player messages, and the Simon buttons.

5. [1/2] There’s a way to return from the settings or the game back to the welcome screen.

-1 cannot return from settings to welcome screen

6. [2/2] The Simon buttons should be displayed in some visually balanced and pleasing way (e.g. good spacing, attractive colours, nice styles), regardless whether there’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 buttons. They should be large enough to tap easily with a finger.

7. [2/2] The message in the game should tell the player what’s happening in the game state, when it’s their turn, if they just lost or won, etc.

8. [1/2] When the computer is playing the sequence, the buttons “flash” for a duration of time to indicate the pattern that the user needs to replicate.
You can choose what “flash” means, the important thing is the user can clearly see when a button is played in the sequence.

-1 Cannot tell which button flashes as they all flash at the same time

9. [1/2] The playback speed of the sequence is determined by the selected difficulty level. Also the sequence pattern length increases by 1 on each successfully completed round, and returns to 1 when the user loses.

-1 difficulty not implemented

10. [0/2] The player can tap on buttons only when it’s “their turn”. The buttons are not active when the sequence is played or when the game was just won or lost.

-1 can tap on buttons when the sequence is being played
-1 can tap on buttons directly after losing or winning

11. [2/2] The player loses when they don’t complete a sequence correctly. There should be clear feedback that they lost (a message, changes in colour, etc.). After losing the player can start a new game or return to the welcome screen to read the instructions again or change settings.

12. [2/2] If the player completes a sequence correctly, clear feedback indicates they won, and they can start another round. The score is also increased by 1.
